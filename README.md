# FUXIï¼šA global computational efficient path planner for UAVs
It is a global computational efficient path planner for UAVs, now it can work perfectly in the Gazebo simulation environment. It can work with the default GPS positioning tools in Gazebo/PX4 and a 2D grid map which can be obtained from some mapping kit like Octomap.
Before you run the demo, you are required to install the following python tools:

pip install pymavlink 

pip install scikit-learn

cd /fuxi-planner/launch

./st_start.sh  (start the planning demo with ccmapping)

After the UAV takeoff or reach its goal, you have 200 seconds to publish the next goal, or it will land on the ground.
